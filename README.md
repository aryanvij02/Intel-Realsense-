# Intel-Realsense-
A simple Python Script to access the Intel Realsense camera and take automated images based on a timer. 
Most of the code is taken from Intel. 
Monir additions have been made to add the functionality to take photos based on a timer. 
Can come in handy when trying to take images to create a large dataset. 
Merely change the total_photos and the countdown (in seconds)
